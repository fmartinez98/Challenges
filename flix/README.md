## About the App

This app was made in react native in order to carry out the Flix React Native coding challenge.


## How The App Works

The app is meant to only retrive data and show it on a table-list on screen. There are 3 buttons, each one made to test the storage and fetching functionalities of the app. Also if needed it is possible to see on the terminal which actions are being carried around (for example if data is retrive from storage or http).
